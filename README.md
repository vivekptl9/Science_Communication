# Science Communication/Popularization
Since 2011, I've been involved in science outreach and public education initiatives. The Sardar Vallabhbhai National Institute of Technology (SVNIT) in Surat, India, was where I used to work. I've designed and led a number of seminars aimed at helping educators have more fun while developing effective teaching strategies. Students engaged in a sci-fi movie discussion following a screening of a science fiction film in which they discussed various aspects of the film using scientific truth and artistic license as a guide. I conducted a number of workshops on career counseling in the areas of research and possibilities for students at all levels of education This repository isÂ a collection of photos and presentations that I used to spread the word about science in my hometown of Surat, India.
