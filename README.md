# Science Communication/Popularization
My involvement in public outreach and education programmes in the field of science began in 2011. I used to be an employee at the Sardar Vallabhbhai National Institute of Technology (SVNIT) in Surat, India. Many of the workshops I've developed and conducted have encouraged participants to have more fun while learning how to become better educators. After watching a science fiction film, students participated in a class discussion in which they dissected the movie using scientific accuracy and creative freedom as criteria. For students of all academic levels, I have led a series of workshops on career counselling, focusing on the latest findings and opportunities in the field. This archive is a compilation of slideshows and photographs I used to promote scientific literacy in my native Surat, India.
