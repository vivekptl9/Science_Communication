# Science Communication/Popularization

I have engaged myself with science popularization since 2011. I worked in Sardar Vallabhbhai National institute of technology (SVNIT), Surat, India. 
I have a conducted and organized many workshops and fun while learn teaching methods to get maximum engagement of the students. 
Some of the events which I organized were PCB making workshop, Science quiz, Dart game based on physics questions, Sci-fi movie in weekend followed by a discussion where students engage to explain various aspects of movie based on scientific accuracy and artistic freedom. 
I also did many workshops on career counselling in the field of research and opportunities at various level of studies both in India and abroad.
This repository is an album of pictures and presentations which I gave to popularize science in my hometown, Surat.
